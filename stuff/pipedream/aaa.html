<p>The highest level of national pride and sense of achievement is felt with a successful manned space program like that which put a man on the moon. Australians can only imagine how it must have felt to be an American on that momentous day in July 1969 that saw Neil Armstrong take that first step. This event thrust the United States to the globally perceived forefront of technology and also secured clear military and political advantage. Other nations have since attempted to capitalise on the effect that achievements in space can have by the establishment of their own space agencies.</p>

<p>Australia currently spends large sums of money in the use of space technologies developed overseas, but with improved industry coordination and infrastructure, we could more support our own space industries and gain opportunities for support from other nations. There is no shortage of highly intelligent and capable researchers here, and they are making significant achievements in aerospace fields even on shoestring budgets, and with minimal infrastructure and acknowledgement. Just imagine what could be achieved with improved infrastructure and channelling of funds, as well as support and encouragement from the Australian public.</p>

<p>What is the Australian Aerospace Administration?</p>

<p>While many countries around the world already have national agencies to coordinate large aerospace research and development programs, Australia doesn't. The Australian Aerospace Administration will be a non-profit organisation that will conduct activities such as the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Coordination of national aerospace research and development programs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Act as the central point of contact for people interested in anything related to space or aviation in Australia.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Cooperation with international agencies to contribute to multinational projects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Promotion and development of public awareness and understanding of aerospace activities and opportunities.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Increasing education opportunities for Australians in aerospace and related fields, including further integration of space science into primary and secondary school curriculum.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Running of regular local and international conferences and workshops to give Australians the opportunity to establish expertise and recognition in their chosen aerospace field.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Establishment and management of subsidiary startup businesses to generate revenue, and mass-marketing of these subsidiaries to drive consumer sentiment (based on the non-profit nature of the enterprise)</p>

<p>Why does Australia need a national aerospace administration?</p>

<p>The greatest beneficiaries of an aerospace administration in Australia will be future generations. How many kids think about becoming astronauts at some point? Inspiration of the young to achieve serves as significant justification for the establishment of the administration, with it helping to give anyone interested in anything aerospace the opportunity to live their dreams.</p>

<p>Other important reasons include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The willingness for national and international cooperation within the industry already exists.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Australia will be in a better position to be able to contribute to the international space community.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Opportunities for Australian researchers to make significant discoveries.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Further expansion of knowledge and horizons.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The ability to conduct projects of a larger scale.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The existence of a significant base of aerospace skills and expertise already.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Opening up and cornering of aerospace and related markets in Australia and globally. <b> <<<< LAST, BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST (SOME WOULD CONSIDER THIS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT JUSTIFICATION)</b></p>

<p><b>Need Analysis</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt"><i>Author: Jared Crutchfield<br>Modified: 5 May 2011</i></span></p>

<p>Australia doesn't currently "need" a space program, as we're fairing reasonably well without one, but in the not too distant future we'll realise that we should have established one long ago.</p>

<p>It takes years for the infrastructure, legislation, facilities and personnel to be prepared to operate a fully fledged program, so when the time comes that space programs are needed, Australia will have to invest significant time and money to merely play catchup to other nations.</p>

<p>Many other nations around the world now already have established national space agencies, and while they may not be doing much in space, they are still establishing the collaborative foundation required to build a program.</p>

<p>It's not a matter of whether a space program is needed for a nation to survive, but development of space technology will play an ever increasing role in the economic, political and social success and stability of a nation into the future.</p>

<p>Most people want to live comfortably and happy. There are many factors in the achievement of this, an extremely important one being the international status of the nation where we live.</p>

<p>Australia has enjoyed the status of being one of the luckiest and most successful nations of the world. This is true economically, politically and socially. Our remoteness has meant that conflicts have usually occurred away from our shores.</p>

<p>This will not remain the case forever though. We can't rely on luck and location to get us over the line in the future. We need to actively pursue development trends to keep up with or lead the rest of the world. Technological development is, and always has been key to the success of nations.</p>

<p>If we position ourselves at the forefront of technological development in a number of fields, it can be assumed that we can have the most opportunity to enjoy comfortable and happy lives well into the future.</p>

<p>While Australia is considered a world leader in certain technological fields, such as medicine, our aerospace industry is not one to be proud of. While it struggles to make significant achievements, such as the development and testing of a successful supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet), the lengths that need to be gone to for achievements like this mean that they are few and far between.</p>

<p><b>Questions and answers for the skeptic...</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt"><i>Author: Jared Crutchfield<br>Modified: July 2010</i></span></p>

<p>Won’t AAA just add yet another organisation to an already fragmented industry?</p>

<p>In the United States there are many more different aerospace organisations doing their own thing than there are in Australia. The fragmentation of our aerospace industry isn’t related to the number of organisations that exist. The cause of fragmentation is lack of communication and coordination. In the US, NASA exists to facilitate cooperation between organisations. An administrating organisation (such as NASA) can provide other organisations with the common ground that is necessary for collaboration on equal terms. AAA's business model and multiple funding sources will mean that researchers will come to AAA as it will likely make the most money available for their purpose.</p>

<p>Won’t AAA add another level of bureaucracy for researchers to tackle to conduct or be involved in projects?</p>

<p>The intention of the administration is to remove all other levels of bureaucracy. Currently, if a researcher wants a grant for their project, they have to either approach the government or a university. Industry support is very hard to come by but is sometimes possible. With an administering body such as AAA, publicity will ensure that researchers are aware that they can come directly to the organisation, have their proposal peer reviewed and assessed, and funding can be channelled from a number of sources. The researcher may also be given the opportunity to work directly with a sponsoring organisation. The administration can connect researchers with colleagues in their field and provide information regarding any projects already being undertaken both in Australia and overseas. Peer review enables communication in the language of that field, rather than a researcher having to convince people with little or no experience in that field as may be the case if government or the private sector were approached.</p>

<p>This document is a proposal for a non-profit organisation, which would administer Australian aerospace research and development activities. The proposal is a work in progress.</p>

<p>The passing of a proposed Australian Aerospace Act would secure the organisation as being Australia's official national aerospace research and development administration.

The intention of the Act is to give the organisation, by all means possible, a significant chance at becoming one of the largest aerospace research and development organisations in the world.</p>

<p><i>The establishment of a viable Australian national aerospace research and development administration could potentially be the most important achievement for the future of this nation since Federation.</i></p>

<!-- Purpose of the Act -->

<p><a id="purpose"><b>Purpose of the Act</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Keep in mind as you read this that the Australian Aerospace Administration is not intended to be a branch or department of the Federal Government. In fact, if it were to become that, its chance of success would be nil. While government departments are gradually improving, they will never be known for their efficiency or value for money. The administration should be operated as an independent private business (in the form of a non-profit organisation) who's sole "shareholder" (or benefactor) is internally managed aerospace research and development projects. There will be no floating on the stock market or long term private investment (though short term venture capital may be an option during establishment).</p>

<p>The purpose of the Act is largely administrative, and if significant industry concensus can be met on its own the Act may not be necessary at all. If industry squabbling remains a roadblock, government lobbying for a newly established body with legislative status may be a way forward.</p>

<p>Such an Act would give meaning to one of the goals of the organisation; to be globally recognised as the core of Australia's aerospace research and development efforts. There are quite a few fairly small organisations and companies in Australia that conduct research and other aerospace activities, and while in many cases they contribute significantly to Australia's achievements, these organisations aren't receiving the local support that they deserve and require to sustain operation. Prime examples include the bankruptcy of the Australia Pacific Space Corporation (APSC) located on Christmas Island, and the fact that the funding required for producing a prototype scramjet was almost entirely sourced overseas. With Federal recognition as the nation's representative aerospace organisation, both Australian companies and the Australian public will have to treat this organisation and what it stands for with respect. It will also put an end to squabbling within the industry, with every organisation fighting to maintain their significance, which will be unneccesary when this government recognised administration comes into being.</p>

<p>The Act could create a permanent, regular communication link between the organisation and the Federal Government through the establishment of a council. This council could provide a direct and official communication interface between the organisation and the Federal Government, enabling the organisation to gain a perspective from the Government of issues of national relevance and importance for current and future planning, to provide a means of enabling presentation of both Government and organisation requests or proposals which can be discussed and acted upon at short notice, and to enable discussion and informed decision making regarding the security and defence of Australia's air and space.</p>

<p>The Act should secure financial support from the Federal Government. While financial support from the government is intended to be of continually reducing importance as the organisation builds its subsidiaries, in the beginning it may be necessary if other sources of funding are difficult to come by. It will also be important if the organisation faces anti-competitive practices from the corporate world (refer to <a href="#competition">Competition</a> section for further discussion of this issue).</p>

<p>A future objective may be to incorporate all other Acts related to the aerospace industry. This would be similar to the US Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 (Aeronautics and Space). This would likely assist in reducing the complexity of law related to the aerospace industry, so that those who wish to know about an aspect of the law will know straight away where or who to turn to first as opposed to disparate unrelated (and potentially conflicting) statutes. As the organisation will focus heavily on public and industry awareness, public relations will play an important role and people with the knowledge will be ready to answer any queries that may arise. If someone wants to conduct a project with the organisation, they don't have to worry about legalities or regulatory requirements as they would be handled by the organisation. All proposals would be checked by experts during reviews. It would also be useful for the administration to represent a statute authority over aerospace activities in Australia, such as roles currently undertaken by the Space Licensing and Safety Office (Space Activities Act) and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Civil Aviation Act), amongst others. Safety is of course paramount with aerospace activities, but creating a restrictive and costly minefield of red tape will stifle innovation. Government authorities are notoriously overcautious (and inefficient) due to lack of technically experienced personnel in their ranks (particularly if they are required to certify new technology), making it more difficult to limit their exposure to potential litigation should something with their approval go wrong. The administration, having the required infrastructure and personnel in place, will better facilitate critical expert reviews and monitoring of activities conducted by the organisation because its mandate isn't restricted to regulation, meaning that it can gainfully employ many more staff qualified to be involved in the regulatory process but only as required. Risk would be bore by the organisation (having established its own insurance company and various internal policies). This would place less financial strain on people wishing to become involved in space activities, and also on the taxpayer in administrative costs of operating separate authorities. A single funding channel could exist between the Federal Government and all aerospace infrastructure and activities.</p>

<p>The organisation would set up its own internal insurance policy, where a particular amount is put aside for any insurance issues later. It isn't expected that there will be any significant losses in the beginning at least until facilities and infrastructure are in place.</p>

<p>The Act could prevent pressure from individual state governments by mandating that the organisation is responsible only to the Federal Government, regardless of which state the organisation operates. The intention of this is to reduce the effect of any pressure for contribution by multiple states, which occurs in the United States and contributed to some extent to the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster.</p>

<p>The Act could provide the organisation with legal and financial concessions, such as those particularly relating to launch vehicles. This may also include limitation of liability without insurance, as insurance costs will significantly reduce research and development capabilities. Such concessions should be promoted for other non-profit organisations of national interest. Limitation of liability might include financial limitations on compensation payouts to those adversely affected by organisational activities such as death due to a stray launch vehicle or damage to property, although it would be fair to pay them a reasonable amount and the administration's internal policy would be set up to underwrite this.</p>

<p>It may be useful to excuse the organisation from such regulations as the Fair Work Act, as this is primarily for fairness to employees of companies out to make a profit for private investors. As the organisation aims to provide as much funding as possible to research and development, it should not be encumbered by minimum pay requirements. This is not to say that staff should not be paid fairly, but on a different scale decided by the organisation due to its non-profit nature. Awards could form a basis, but they are tipped too much in favour of senior management. The organisation should be able to make it clear that those after a high paid cushy management job should look elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Everyone down to the guy sweeping the floor is honoured to be a part of it" - Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell in the Apollo 13 movie referring to the Apollo Space Program.</p>

<p>The organisation should be given every opportunity available to continue to push Australia further ahead in the development of aerospace technology, including involvement in private and commercial enterprise and the opportunity to have input into any future legislation proposals, which should ideally be incorporated into this Act anyway. Involvement in commercial enterprises can be beneficial to both parties. The organisation can expand its profile, and the enterprising party can gain from the expertise, experience, infrastructure and exposure of the organisation.</p>

<p>The Act could ensure that the organisation has free reign on deciding its own goals and activities, based on informed opinion from multiple sources, potentially reducing the likelihood of any adverse political implications or influence from those who aren't informed. It will be a priority of the organisation to stay as informed as possible. There are also many other industries that are both beneficiary to and that benefit from aerospace development, including medicine, sciences, information technology, manufacturing, mineral processing, electronics, nutrition, fitness, physics, mathematics and also specialist industries such as those linked to development of cars and boats. The organisation should be able to become involved in these industries, and other industries that it can contribute to improve the general quality of life.</p>

<p>The Act should ideally establish the organisation as the prime contractor for aerospace vehicles of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) when it is capable of providing this service. This would ensure periodic business for the organisation, and will also strengthen the argument for financial support from the government early on, as it would be supporting the eventual purchase of aerospacecraft from a local supplier at potentially much lower cost than the sale price imposed by foreign aerospace companies. The revenue earned by the organisation will go to support Australian jobs and achievements.</p>

<!-- Vision of the Organisation -->

<p><a id="vision"><b>Vision of the Organisation</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The organisation may initially aim to research and develop technologies that will:</p>

<p>1.	lead to infinitely sustainable human habitation of space,<br>
2.	make space accessible to the average person,<br>
3.	enable continued exploration of space and discovery of its inhabitants, and<br>
4.	improve the quality of life on Earth.</p>

<p>To achieve the above, the organisation should aim to be as large and far reaching as possible, eventually spanning all continents of the globe, with the initial focus of bringing Australia as a nation into the 21st century, even if it has to be dragged by its ears. The eventual focus of the organisation should be not so much on Australian industry, but worldwide cooperation regarding aerospace research and development.</p>

<p>People are naturally resistant to change, as it can lead to unknown consequences, but change is necessary for the growth and development of a nation, and the Australian people need to be reminded of the importance of this, and the importance that aerospace research and development will play in the future growth of all developed nations.</p>

<!-- Roles of the Organisation -->

<p><a id="role"><b>Roles of the Organisation</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The roles of the organisation may include:</p>

<p>1.	acting as an advisory and managing agency to the aerospace industry for issues including but not limited to those relating to law, administration, current local and international activities, marketing and public relations, finances and budgeting, project management, international law and treaties, planning, and human resources,<br>
2.	unifying the efforts of researchers developing aerospace technologies,<br>
3.	acting as a centralised aerospace technology information resource,<br>
4.	keeping the Australian public informed of the developments in aerospace technology both in Australia and overseas,<br>
5.	keeping the international community informed of Australian developments in aerospace technology,<br>
6.	serving as an centralised interface between the public and researchers,<br>
7.	serving as a centralised point of entry into aerospace technology research and development,<br>
8.	promoting interest in the research and development of aerospace technology,<br>
9.	acting as a centralised funding generator for Australian aerospace research and development,<br>
10.	liaising with local and foreign companies developing aerospace technologies,<br>
11.	helping ensure that aerospace technology is used for humane purposes only,<br>
12.	administering Australian space activities, and<br>
13.	establishing and building a network of subsidiary businesses intended to eventually provide the majority of funding for the realisation of the vision of the organisation.</p>

<!-- Funding -->

<p><a id="funding"><b>Funding</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Sources of funding and support will primarily originate from:</p>

<p>1.	the Australian Federal Government,<br>
2.	private companies,<br>
3.	universities,<br>
4.	current aerospace research and development organisations, and<br>
5.	organisation operated enterprise (subsidiaries).</p>

<p>The organisation would establish subsidiary businesses in markets where consumer sentiment can be leveraged in favour of the organisation. Consumer sentiment may be drawn by the non-profit nature of the organisation and the ideals that the organisation represents. Consumers are continually frustrated by reports of excessive profits reported by corporate financial institutions in particular, and are furious when there are reports of overpaid executives and "golden handshakes". Mass marketing and persistent advertising campaigns are crucial to convince consumers that they should "bank" with AAA. Marketing must highlight not only the ideals of the organisation, but also the pitfalls of the competition. It will become highly political, but that is of course the nature of competitive business. AAA must always hold the moral high ground.</p>

<p>Sometime in the future the organisation could launch a satellite TV and Internet service subsidiary, as well as satellite phone services. Satellite services operated by the organisation should of course eventually use satellites developed and launched by the organisation.</p>

<p>Revenues can be generated in the future by surface-orbit shuttle services and the sale of products developed from new technologies. The organisation could also sell the rights to use information or data obtained from research by other companies (if the organisation doesn't make use of it first).</p>

<p>Employment of a large, reasonably paid and well looked after workforce will go towards ensuring a high level of morale, enthusiasm and therefore productivity. Prevention of payment of high salaries will positively affect the middle and low level employees, and it will help to maintain a good financial position for the organisation. It will also help to maintain positive public relations.</p>

<p>Additional or alternative to unsecured business startup loans from banks might be loans from companies, organisations, individuals, governments etc. Lower interest rates may be negotiated from other sources than would otherwise be posible with banks, particularly if they have specific interest in the aerospace industry and if they would further benefit from the ultimate success of the organisation.</p>

<!-- Facilities & Infrastructure -->

<p><a id="infrastructure"><b>Facilities & Infrastructure</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The organisation will need a physical headquarters. It should be designed with the vision, goals and objectives of the organisation in mind. First impressions last, so the lobby should be awe-inspiring and present the organisation well to visitors. Subsidiary companies shall be allocated floor space, and floors may be rented out to partner organisations. The building could be designed to grow as required.</p>

<p>Alternatively, Earth-based facilities might be constructed as required, with the long-term goal of relocation of operations to space-based facilities. Eventually a large space station will be realised at a Lagrange point (refer to article <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=lagrange","here"); ?>) and the organisation headquarters would ideally be located there.</p>

<p>A national aerospace conference complex might be constructed as a world-class conference facility, able to host a number of international conferences simultaneously.</p>

<p>Bases should be established (similar to RAAF bases) to enable divisions or subsidiaries of the organisation to conduct their activities, particularly those related to research and development.</p>

<p>The organisation should have large flat screens constructed near the centres of major cities of Australia, broadcasting constantly. Commercial free-to-air and pay television stations around the world could also be offered the rights to broadcast segments. Material that the organisation might broadcast includes:</p>

<p>1.	footage of missions flown by flight vehicles with background music,<br>
2.	biographies of personnel including interviews,<br>
3.	aerospace documentaries made by the organisation,<br>
4.	documentaries made by third parties,<br>
5.	news, weather and current affairs programs,<br>
6.	information on activities of the organisation as marquee text on the bottom edge of the screen over other programming,<br>
7.	documentaries about sponsoring companies and organisations, including their achievements and how they are involved,<br>
8.	relaxing and inspiring footage and accompanying low volume music at night, and<br>
9.	sci-fi movies.</p>

<p>The public should be able to park their cars or catch public transport to and from, and sit down and have a picnic or eat at a restaurant, and view the programs broadcast on the screens.</p>

<p>Quiet relaxing music could be played during night programming, so that only those in the immediate vicinity could hear it, and relaxing footage could be shown on the screen, such as the sunset over the horizon with the silhouette of organisation facilities such as the air traffic control tower with its slowly spinning radar antenna, or footage of the everyday activities such as social gatherings, or footage of glider flight, or footage taken from a low flying aircraft of the landscape folding beneath it. There could be a regular programming feature at night showing the events and activities of the day just gone. These events and activities could be significant aerospace developments, or just the common everyday sort of activities. Footage of other landscapes and activities in major cities or small towns could also be broadcast. An opportunity should exist for anyone to submit a program or piece of music for review and potential broadcast, however there should be little or no advertising broadcast.</p>

<p>These parks should have plenty of grassed area, water features and both covered and uncovered seating. The intention of these parks would not only be to keep the public informed of the latest local and international aerospace achievements, but also to serve as an entertainment venue and place where people can derive some sort of peace from the nature of mostly non-eventful days being broadcast, and the parks can also enable people to gain a sense of pride in their nation's achievement of the establishment of the organisation.</p>

<p>Large facilities should eventually be established in other countries. Regardless of where facilities are built, the primary base in Australia should always be the largest.</p>

<p>The organisation should aim to establish permanent facilities in Earth orbit and on the surface of the Moon in the not too distant future.</p>

<p>Through the establishment of these facilities, the organisation could become one of the largest employers in the world.</p>

<!-- Future International Goals -->

<p><a id="goals"><b>Future International Goals</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Cooperation between international governments and organisations to form a new non-profit multinational aerospace research and development organisation that is independent of any particular state or party (similar to the United Nations but without a Security Council) would allow very large scale multi-trillion dollar projects to be conducted. To make significant achievements in space technology, multinational cooperation is crucial.</p>

<!-- Proposed Projects and Activities -->

<p><a id="activities"><b>Proposed Projects and Activities</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Major projects that the organisation could aim to undertake or partake in the long term might include:</p>

<p>1.	production of a fleet of cheap, fully reusable, reliable, fast and safe shuttles for transport of material and personnel payloads into Earth orbit,<br>
2.	development of an effective space rescue system,<br>
3.	development of a permanent, self sufficient and sustainable Earth-orbiting space station with mineral processing, recycling, and manufacturing facilities, as well as facilities for the production of space vehicles of any size,<br>
4.	development of systems capable of infinitely sustainable conversion of energy into useful forms, and<br>
5.	establishment of a permanently inhabited base on the surface of the Moon, with mineral mining and transport facilities, and a large deep space observatory.</p>

<p>Other projects and activities might include:</p>

<p>1.	promoting space science and technology in schools through the development of education packs for teachers of all year levels,<br>
2.	running of internationally recognised TAFE, undergraduate and post-graduate courses in aerospace related fields of expertise,<br>
3.	establishing a new television channel with live broadcasts of research and development activities in Australia and overseas, industry related reports, news, interviews, forums, documentaries and movies,<br>
4.	development of a flight testing dummy and associated virtual reality ground control systems to eliminate the safety risks of human flight testing,<br>
5.	development of an advanced multi-user virtual reality combat simulation system for training personnel in the Australian Defence Force,<br>
6.	running of regular local and international conferences and workshops, giving scientists and engineers the opportunity to become recognised in their chosen field, and providing an environment where constructive brainstorming and idea development can take place,<br>
7.	development of research packs with a system similar to the one that the Australian Space Research Institute (ASRI) uses, so that interested members of the public can work on something at their own pace, and<br>
8.	integration of conceptual problems into student tasks at various educational institutions where possible.</p>

<!-- Competition -->

<p><a id="competition"><b>Competition</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>It has been shown in the past that large aerospace companies can drive smaller companies to bankruptcy by temporarily running at a loss, thereby gaining customers that the smaller company might have been able to service, to the detriment of the smaller company. When the smaller company is eliminated, the larger company restores its prices to their original value. This is anti-competitive, and due to the high cost of aerospace vehicles and the small number of sales, new or small companies can go bankrupt fairly quickly.</p>

<p>To protect this organisation initially, it will need business and financial support from the Federal Government to ensure a regular income. Over time as the organisation increases in size and becomes more financially independent, Government support may be reduced. However, if a local or international company attempts to bankrupt the organisation through lowering its prices to below cost price, the organisation must be able to resume full Government subsidisation to combat the threat. If anti-competitive business occurs, a global public awareness campaign may help to prevent further malpractice by the company in question. Support from other organisations and established companies in threat of class action may also be possible.</p>

<p>The global aerospace industry is highly competitive, and while the organisation could look into airliner production, it may be less viable than space vehicle research and development due to a fairly saturated market. The airline industry isn't in a position favourable for newcomers in airliner manufacturing due to world events leading to a decrease in air travel. This may change in the future, and so should be looked into, and a feasibility study conducted.</p>

<p>The defence strategy of many nations today involves the development of large mobile offensive hardware like aircraft, shipping, and ground vehicles such as tanks. In today's political and social environment however, there is increased political risks from engaging in direct large scale military action. The public of not only the nations directly involved in military action during the recent war in Iraq, but of many other nations whose governments were either neutral or opposed to military action were deeply divided, and there were world-wide peace rallies organised which in some cases were attended by millions of people. This has also occurred during other conflicts in the past, such as operations in Vietnam and Korea.</p>

<p>The threat to national security is also changing. Mostly prior to World War II, the threat lay in occupation by hostile foreign nations such as Germany and Japan, whereas now the threat is more from multinational terrorist networks and terrorist cells. These cells are very difficult to break down, and it has been shown that only after significant acts of terror, such as those on the World Trade Center in New York City and in Bali, is substantial progress made.</p>

<p>Conventional military threats, such as the threat of occupation by a hostile nation, should be dealt with in the future through either diplomacy or through the employment of an offshore defensive barrier, such that the threat is halted before reaching the nation's shores. This could be accomplished by the construction of multiple underground conventional missile silos. Countermeasures and early-warning systems could also be useful. Using a system such as this, both naval and aerial threats could be neutralised before even reaching the mainland. Multilateral diplomatic pressure could also be employed.</p>

<p>Australia's offensive solution should consist of the development of smaller unmanned mobile offensive hardware, which could be controlled remotely, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and satellites for intelligence gathering to coordinate offensive activities.</p>

<p>To combat the threat of terrorism, the use of satellites for intelligence gathering becomes very important through the ability to obtain high resolution images of suspected areas of terrorist activity. This eliminates any risk of loss of life, allows for intelligence gathering without intervention, and is fast and easy. Then using small highly trained specialised combat teams similar to those of the SAS, terrorist threats could be neutralised swiftly and by surprise, and with less risk of civilian casualties.</p>

<p>Australia is currently fairly highly regarded for its intelligence gathering capabilities. However, we make use of foreign satellites, at great expense to the tax payer.</p>

<!-- Benefit to the Australian People -->

<p><a id="benefits_local"><b>Benefit to the Australian People</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Australians will benefit from the organisation by the following:</p>

<p>1.	Creation of many jobs for people in many professions, not only in the aerospace industry, but in other supporting fields such as information technology, construction, medicine, manufacturing, trades, engineering, management, marketing, public relations, finance and politics,<br>
2.	opportunities for university graduates to undertake research in their chosen field,<br>
3.	a sense of national pride from knowledge of Australia's aerospace achievements on the global scale,<br>
4.	contributing to Australia's economy by keeping financial resources that would otherwise be spent overseas in Australia,<br>
5.	reducing the "brain drain" by giving young Australian talent a reason to remain in Australia,<br>
6.	development of products that use technologies developed by research within the organisation,<br>
7.	drawing of business from overseas instead of Australia contributing to overseas business,<br>
8.	improvement of Australia's international profile, becoming a leader in the development of aerospace technologies,<br>
9.	enabling individuals, organisations or companies to accomplish projects to lift their profile by assisting with aspects such as funding (the smaller the project, the harder it is to get funding on its own, and those involved in a project ideally don't want to have to worry about funding),<br>
9.	expansion of Australian expertise and experience in development of aerospace technologies, and<br>
10.	the ability of Australia to become involved in large-scale international space projects.</p>

<p>Other beneficiaries would include:</p>

<p>1.	international space agencies through the addition of another sponsoring agency for major multinational projects, and<br>
2.	users of aerospace technologies by the increased availability of aerospace services in Australia to meet potential demand both now and in the future.</p>

<!-- Case Studies to Show Benefits of the Proposed Administration -->

<p><a id="benefits_cases"><b>Case Studies to Show Benefits of the Proposed Administration</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>CASE 1: MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC</p>

<p>What does the average member of the Australian public want? It can be assumed that they want to live life peacefully, comfortably and happily. Let's deal with each of these three aspects individually:<p>

<p>Peace:</p>

<p>In the past, the remoteness of Australia relative to the majority of populated continents of the world meant that it was inherently more secure. Due to both the advances in military technology, and the changing face of threat to peace, Australians can no longer be complacent about security. While the risk of occupation by hostile nationalities has decreased since World War II, a new threat has risen to become the top priority in defence strategies around the world, particularly for developed nations, this threat being that of terrorism. This isn't the sort of traditional military threat that can be clearly identified, like tank or aircraft. It takes the innocent form of airliners with potentially hundreds of passengers on board, or individual people in crowded shopping plazas. These seemingly innocent parts of everyday life have been used to topple two of the largest skyscrapers in the world, and have killed hundreds of innocent civilians doing their shopping. These threats can't be combated with tanks or aircraft.</p>

<p>The only way terrorism can be dealt with is by intelligence tracking it down and preventing it before it even becomes a threat. While Australia's intelligence gathering can be compared with the best in the world, we rely heavily on other nations for information particularly from satellites. Satellite technology is becoming the new weapon of war in gathering intelligence both for armed military conflict such as in the recent overthrow of the Taliban and Bath Party regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq respectively. Without superior intelligence, these conflicts would have involved much higher numbers of fatalities of both civilians and military personnel alike, due to the changes in the way war is conducted as a result of improved intelligence.</p>

<p>Coalitions are conducting wars through the use of precision guided weapons and elite special operations to target specific military threats rather than using large munitions to devastate entire areas where a threat is perceived to be. This sort of precision targeting is only possible with satellite and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imaging.</p>

<p>A national aerospace administration could greatly improve Australia's status as an intelligence gathering nation, which increases the perception of Australia as a threat to other hostile nations or terrorist organisations without the perception that we are a hostile nation ourselves, as well as putting Australia in a better position to help coalitions such as the United Nations deal with terrorism on the global scale.</p>

<p>While the United States is clearly the leader in the "War Against Terror", through its highly militarised efforts to combat terrorism it is damaging its relations with other peaceful nations, as well as dividing its own people.</p>

<p>Comfort:</p>

<p>It can be shown by statistics that Australians have one of the highest standards of living in the world, but this is only possible through economic growth, and economic and political stability. While our economy is small by comparison with nations like the United States, this is largely because of the difference in population. Per capita, Australia's economy is about level with that of the Unites States. So how could the Australian Aerospace Administration contribute to improving the Australian quality of life when it is already so high? Well, the high quality of life that we see in statistics doesn't apply to everyone. It is only an average obtained through national census. There are many Australians out there doing it pretty tough, especially those living in rural areas affected by ongoing drought conditions.</p>

<p>Also, the future of the Australian economy is unknown, but when looking into the activities of other developed nations, and the general direction in which technology is going, it is fairly clear what industry will define the economic, political and technological prowess of a nation in the future. Many developed nations even nowadays have a national space agency, including seemingly relatively underdeveloped nations like India. The reason for this is because of the importance of satellite technologies, both for defence and civil purposes, and also future prospects such as civilian populated large scale Earth orbiting space stations.</p>

<p>Space industries can and do draw big dollars for those in control of them. Australia currently spends large sums of money in these industries. It is unfortunate however that the industries it supports aren't its own. With greatly improved infrastructure and the unification of efforts by a central administration, Australia could more support its own space industries and gain opportunities for support from other nations.</p>

<p>Happiness:</p>

<p>There are many different things that make people happy, including having a family, a job that they enjoy, or social activities such as going to see a good movie at the cinema. One other thing that most people in the world like to have is pride in the country that they live in. While Australia is a fairly young in terms of colonisation, it has developed at a very rapid pace, and can now boast as being one of the most highly developed nations in the world. However, nations can deteriorate very quickly both economically and politically if they don't keep up with what is going on in the rest of the world.</p>

<p>We all know from the late 1960's the sort of pride and sense of achievement that can be gained out of a fully fledged manned space program like the NASA Apollo program that put a man on the moon. This event not only put the United States at the perceived forefront of technology, but also secured it a clear military and political advantage. Other nations are now starting to quickly capitalise on the effect that achievements in development of space technology can have by the establishment of their own space infrastructure and research programs.</p>

<p>Australia has no shortage of very capable researchers, and they are making significant achievements in development of aerospace technology even without significant funding, infrastructure or acknowledgement, so just imagine what could be achieved with that infrastructure and funding in place, and with the general support and encouragement of the Australian people.</p>

<p>CASE 2: THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</p>

<p>Details regarding a new National Strategic Defence Initiative for Australia, in which a non-profit Australian Aerospace Administration would play an important role, can be found <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=nsdi","here"); ?>.</p>

<p>CASE 3: AUSTRALIAN/FOREIGN AEROSPACE COMPANIES</p>

<p>Private companies won't pay money or offer products or services to an organisation unless they are getting something back out of it, regardless of whether the organisation has non-profit status or not. A national aerospace administration would aim to grow as big as possible as fast as possible, and would aim to have a high public profile. Involvement of companies in this type of organisation would gain significant exposure to both the local and global aerospace industries, presenting the company with opportunities that it wouldn't normally have without this exposure. This would be particularly beneficial to smaller companies offering specialised products or services, and smaller companies could also benefit by securing contracts that might normally be offered to larger companies. Companies could be involved in larger projects than they would normally be able to partake in due to the scale of the organisation. Sponsoring companies could be given priority over other companies for contracts within the organisation, and may also be given priority in partnering with the organisation for business ventures resulting from research conducted within the organisation that is either fully or partially funded by the private company, which may generate large revenues. Association with a non-profit organisation also looks better in the public eye than just selling products or services and making profit. Local companies would generally be given priority over foreign companies.</p>

<p>CASE 4: AUSTRALIAN AEROSPACE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONS</p>

<p>Most of Australia's aerospace research and development organisations are fairly small, and it is difficult for them to secure funding from the Government, which is generally essential for their survival unless they have gained private investment. They also have to deal with administrative duties such as human resources and funds management, which are usually taken care of by people who aren't professionals in these fields. A central national administration can handle securing of funds from a greater number of sources due to its size, official status and exposure, and administrative roles can be filled by professionals in the relevant fields, leaving those in the current research and development organisations to undertake what they set out to do in the first place; research and development. Researchers can be involved in larger scale projects as with private companies, expanding their expertise and experience in areas not possible with a smaller budget, and playing a role in deciding the future of the organisation by putting forward proposals. They could also be involved in administrative duties such as reviewing proposals as a member of a panel of experts in their chosen field, or they could form part of the management structure of the organisation.</p>

<p>CASE 5: AUSTRALIAN/FOREIGN NON-AEROSPACE COMPANIES</p>

<p>Non-aerospace related companies could still become involved in a national aerospace organisation by financial support. Companies can boost their public image by gaining exposure as a sponsoring company, which looks good in the public eye. They could also be given the opportunity to invest in business opportunities resulting from organisational activities that could result in large revenues and therefore large profits for companies. For business opportunities, local companies should be given priority over foreign companies regardless of how large the capital investments offered by foreign companies are.</p>

<p>CASE 6: AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITIES</p>

<p>Australian universities could benefit by gaining access to facilities and equipment, as well as administrative infrastructure for extended research activities and learning aids that may be too expensive for individual universities to purchase. They could play a large part in major projects, conducting research and performing experiments.</p>

<p>The organisation could serve as a popular employer for graduates wishing to conduct research, particularly for those universities offering aerospace related courses such as RMIT University and Monash University, as well as offering vacation work and work experience for undergraduates.</p>

<p>CASE 7: FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES</p>

<p>Foreign universities could become involved in Australian research and development activities through an exchange program, where students or professionals come to Australia and use the facilities, infrastructure and expertise of the organisation to assist them with their research. In return, the organisation might have the rights to use the results of any research conducted, or the university could financially support the organisation during the time of the exchange.</p>

<p>CASE 8: FOREIGN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS</p>

<p>Cooperation between an Australian aerospace administration and foreign governments could play a key role in developing plans for large scale multinational projects where the costs involved are too great for individual nations to afford. Other nations could also share research and conduct professional exchanges with the organisation. In exchange for the good will of foreign governments, the organisation could offer companies of nations involved the opportunity to use facilities or infrastructure, or offer priority for involvement in projects. The size and extent of the organisation should minimise the possibility of manipulation by foreign governments or organisations.</p>

<p>In the future, the organisation would expand and construct facilities around the world, providing jobs to people of the country where the facilities are constructed. This expansion would also assist in boosting the economies of those nations by contracting local companies and allowing for increased technological development. The revenue raised in other countries would mostly remain in those countries for further research and development within the organisation there, although some may be used to help establish new infrastructure elsewhere or in major multinational projects.</p>

<p>CASE 9: MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC INTERESTED IN AEROSPACE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p>Members of the Australian public who are interested in aerospace research and development could become involved in projects that the organisation conducts. They could expand their knowledge and experience in a particular area, or gain a perspective of multiple areas of expertise by becoming involved in different aspects. While not everyone could be employed by the organisation, anyone could become involved on a voluntary basis, with the opportunity for employment as a possibility for the future. Active involvement with the organisation on a voluntary basis would look good to organisation selection officers.</p>

<p>The organisation should have a program to support those that are interested in the aerospace industry, including those that don't have any useful qualifications. Applicants who are found to be genuinely interested during an interview process should be encouraged to participate in organisational activities, such as attending launches or learning about current events and developments on the organisation's television broadcast. Interviews should be fairly relaxed, and those conducting the interviews should remember that some people may not have the financial means to show that they are interested in space as much as others. Applicants who haven't any useful qualifications could be offered the chance to participate in short courses that teach people the basics of space science, and space travel including rocketry and aerodynamics. These courses should target people of all ages and level of knowledge, and should be offered for free to individuals. Companies could pay a small fee per person, or offer the organisation their products or services in exchange.</p>

<p>CASE 10: AUSTRALIAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS INTERESTED IN AEROSPACE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</p>

<p>Australian university students could benefit from a national aerospace administration from the opportunities to become involved in aerospace projects that the organisation would present. This will both develop their skills and knowledge, and enhance their employment prospects. The organisation could also offer employment opportunities to university students after they graduate.</p>

<p><a id="organisation_name"><b>Proposed Organisation Name</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The choice of "Australian Aerospace Administration" as the name of the organisation came about because it describes the role of the organisation well, which in short is to administer the activities of the majority of the Australian aerospace industry. It also conveys a sense of authority. The short-hand form of the organisation name would be "AAA", pronounced "triple A", which may appeal to the values of an increasingly trendy society.</p>

<p><a id="organisation_logo"><b>Proposed Organisation Logo</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p><img src="logo.jpg" alt="Australian Aerospace Administration"></p>

<p>This logo is simple and easy to recognise, and it represents the acronym of the organisation name well (AAA).</p>

<p><a id="why_now"><b>Why hasn't this been done before?</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Establishing and operating an organisation of the scale proposed will not be easy by any stretch of the imagination. It will require dedication and commitment from many individuals and organisations, and will require a high level of cooperation from the Federal Government, which will be difficult to obtain. However, these issues shouldn't deter the industry from working to achieve something this grand.</p>

<p>There have been previous attempts to establish a national space program, but they have all failed. This is most likely because of the way the proposals were gone about, and the form that they took. Any proposal needs to highlight benefits to the entities that it is requesting support from, and include adequate plans for required infrastructure. The economic feasibility of any proposal also needs to be extensively justified.</p>

<p><a id="stifling"><b>Stifling of the Proposal in Development Stages</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Australia has close ties with the United States, and as a result, there isn't too much that goes on in Australia that the US doesn't know about. If it sees potential competition to Boeing or other US aerospace companies on the horizon, it may pay its way to seeing the potential competition stifled out of existence. Prior to and during the passing of legislation through Federal Parliament will be the period in which this organisation will be most vulnerable as politicians are generally fairly easily corruptable.</p>

<p>Planning will need to take place to prevent this before the proposal is introduced into Parliament, which may include negotiations with US Government and NASA representatives to gain support from them rather than present as competition to them. Emphasis on future international cooperation may be a focus point in this plan. Other foreign governments, companies and organisations may also need to be approached. Establishing good relationships with Federal Government members may also work in favour of the organisation.</p>

<p><a id="process"><b>The Establishment Process</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The following steps broadly outline the steps involved in establishing the organisation:</p>

<p>1.	Companies and organisations need to be approached to gain support for the development of the proposal, as well as financial, personnel or infrastructure support for the finally proposed organisation.</p>

<p>The costs involved in this activity would have to be absorbed by those involved in the proposal.</p>

<p>These costs might include phone and mail correspondence, stationery and travel. All costs should be kept as low as possible by conducting activities and correspondence efficiently and effectively. Travel can be reduced by making use of electronic communication means such as phone or email, and paper usage should be kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>The timeline for this activity might be over about six to twelve months, but could continue during the next activity.</p>

<p>2.	A Bill for the organisation would then need to be drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. To be officially drafted, the Bill has to be sponsored by a Federal Member of Parliament. The Minister for Industry, Tourism & Resources or the Minister for Science may be considered as possible sponsors.</p>

<p>At this point, the Government may be called upon for assistance such that there would be no cost to those involved in the proposal. The costs of having a Bill drafted will need to be investigated.</p>

<p>3.	During the time when the Bill is being drafted, all the documents which would be required to fully establish the organisation assuming that the Bill is to be assented to must be completed, and preparations for establishing organisation owned and operated businesses need to be made, such that significant works and the proposed public awareness campaign can begin within 24 hours of the ascension of the Bill. For success and to be treated seriously, the organisation must hit the ground running and pursue rapid expansion and awareness campaigns.</p>

<p>Conceptual design should also be initiated on the first major project, with involvement from interested parties. Costs at this point would be to those involved in the proposal, which would have broadened to include private companies and organisations, but costs may be reimbursed if the Bill is assented. The Government may be able to offer services or relatively small amounts of financial support. However it may be difficult to gain financial support from the Government at this fairly uncertain stage.</p>

<p>4.	The Bill would be introduced into Federal Parliament and assented to by the Governor General to become and Act.</p>

<p>5.	Funding should be secured from the Government in accordance with the Act and the various sources established previously, so that works to construct facilities and the planned public awareness campaign can begin immediately on the day that the Bill is assented. Establishment of previously planned organisation owned and operated businesses should occur. Financial support from the Australian Federal Government for material and labour costs may be heavily relied on at this stage of rapid development, but alternate funding strategies must be actively pursued. Marketing and public awareness costs will also be high, but may be negotiated with private companies involved to reduce costs in exchange for future benefits.</p>

<p>6.	Staff should be hired to fill the various roles planned previously. Salaries should initially start at award rates, and should never increase much above this if possible. People hired to work for the organisation should ideally not be financially motivated, but passionate about (or at least interested in) the vision of the organisation. Despite this, raising a family is expensive and families must be an important aspect of working for the organisation, so non-financial incentives must be provided for the families of those employed by the organisation.</p>

<p>7.	Establish information systems planned previously, including organisation web sites. The costs for computer equipment will be fairly high at this point, as the organisation should set up its own infrastructure to reduce costs and external dependence in the future.</p>

<p>8.	While infrastructure is being constructed, the first major project should be initiated, which should be a horizontal takeoff and landing fully reusable single stage to low earth orbit shuttle. Further details on this concept can be found <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=ssto","here"); ?>.</p>

<p>9.	Maintain the planned global public awareness campaign, and continually search out support for the organisation both in Australia and overseas. Eventually, organisation owned and operated subsidiaries should start to generate revenue to offset some of the costs involved. Marketing costs for individual subsidiaries will be completely funded and managed by a dedicated department of the organisation to ensure the campaign is coherent and well integrated, although subsidiary representatives shall be involved in the process to ensure that marketing is effective for their individual business.</p>

<p>Significant concessions will need to be made for the organisation in the proposed Act, including for insurance and taxes. This will relieve a fairly large burden on the organisation and also the Federal Government (and therefore the tax payer) later on.</p>

<p>The majority of Australia's aerospace research and development organisations will need to be involved in the proposal for it to succeed, as well as significant financial support from private companies intending to become involved on either a contractual basis, complete integration, or for increased industry exposure and future contractual or business opportunities.</p>

<p>If the Federal Government can also be persuaded to opt for a new defence initiative (outlined <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=nsdi","here"); ?>), which would be established after the organisation reaches a certain stage of development, with the organisation being the primary contractor, some of the national defence budget could be diverted to the organisation. This would also offer an incentive for defence contractors like BAE SYSTEMS and Boeing to become involved with the organisation, as they can be sub-contracted on a long term rather than on a periodic basis, and they can also be involved in larger scale projects in Australia such as space vehicle, space station and satellite development.</p>

<p><a id="demand"><b>Market Demand</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>The organisation may conduct some satellite launches for the Australian Defence Force and major companies, but there are serious limitations to the commercial feasibility of launching satellites. They are both expensive to develop and launch, which restricts launching by mainly large telecommunications companies such as Optus. There are already enough established commercial launchers for satellites. This may change with development of new technologies making satellite development and launching cheaper, but satellites shouldn't be looked at by the organisation as an option for sustainability.</p>

<p>There can't be market demand unless there is a market. To say that there would be no commercial demand for cheaper space services without there being a market to generate that demand is misleading and only helps to worsen the situation that we are starting to find ourselves deep in. Without the provision of a local industrial base to develop technologies to create a new market for cheaper space access and generate demand over time, the opportunities that are associated with the generation of new market demands will eventually be seized upon by other nations or large multinational companies. This is happening to a fairly small extent now in Australia due to the increasing number of satellite projects being conducted but having to launch overseas at great expense. A recent example of this is the FedSat project, being developed by a consortium of Australian interests, but being launched by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). While this launch was provided free of charge (but not cheap after transport costs are taken into account), it was to allow the Japanese launcher to claim itself as a multinational. Free launches can't be relied on for the future of Australian satellite and space projects. The funding is slowly being generated for some great projects here, but large amounts of that funding is leaving the country because of a lack of satellite launch facilities.</p>

<p>Future market opportunities lie in space tourism, not only for transport between the surface of the Earth and orbit, but facilities in orbit for the accommodation of large numbers of short to medium stay tourists. There may also be opportunities in manufacturing of precision miniature crystalline components requiring a microgravity environment to form. Such components might be used for powering tomorrow's computers. There would be many other innovative commercially viable ideas out there that could come to fruition with the support of a national aerospace administration. Ideally, the organisation would play a significant role in paving the way for permanent space habitiation where a rented "apartment" of sorts in a large space station may be home to those working full time in space, along with their families.</p>

<p><a id="benefits_aero"><b>The Benefits of Aerospace Research & Development</b></a> <span style="font-size: 8pt">(<a href="#">top</a>) (<a href="#contents">contents</a>)</span></p>

<p>Many people even in the aerospace industry question the value and usefulness of the International Space Station (ISS), especially now after the recent loss of the Columbia space shuttle and indefinite suspension of activities for the remainder of the shuttle fleet.</p>

<p>It may be argued that research in a microgravity environment can lead to new discoveries, or that the station has always been just a necessary step to much bigger things like interplanetary exploration.</p>

<p>Could more be done to achieve these next steps? Would it really be that much harder to develop a station of increased capabilities, like living space for over one hundred scientists, engineers and civilians? The station could be used not only for research in space, but facilities and space vehicles could be constructed in Earth orbit from raw materials which could be mined from a location with less gravity like the moon, requiring less energy to haul it into space. This ability would be a significant step forward in the ultimate goal of further human space exploration.</p>

<p>Traditional concepts could be employed, such as gravity via the spinning of a wheel shaped station, with the nuclear power generator used to power a magnetic field capable of deflecting harmful radiation. The station could be constructed in one of the proposed Lagrange points between the Earth and Moon. Further details on this concept can be found <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=lagrange","here"); ?>.</p>

<p>Space tethers could be used to haul cargo between LEO and the station, or a smaller intermediate docking facility could be employed in a lower orbit. The ISS may serve as a suitable intermediate docking facility in such a proposal.</p>

<p>Such a large scale proposal would be more useful for commercial activities such as tourism to offset the cost of an otherwise mostly Government funded operation.</p>

<p>The reason for the necessity to push forward in exploration isn't so much related to material or environmental considerations. There have been studies conducted to show that the Earth won't die as a result of our activities for quite some time yet. It more concerns our tendency to want to do something exciting as nations. It could be suggested that wars originate from boredom, and a desire for national relevancy. Religion also serves to give life more meaning. Exploration takes so much more effort and can involve many more people working together to achieve something possibly far greater than anything else... <i>discovery of the unknown</i>.</p>

<p><b>Local Business Development Program</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt"><i>Author: Jared Crutchfield<br>Modified: July 2010</i></span></p>

<p>The administration should establish a program to encourage other regular Australians to establish new non-trading co-operative businesses that:</p>

<p>1. have no shareholders (being non-trading co-operatives),<br>
2. provide local jobs and salaries,<br>
3. compete in respective domestic and international markets, and<br>
4. are managed by people not interested in making money as much as helping the Australian economy and providing other regular Australians with livelihoods and a chance to succeed themselves.</p>

<p>Members of the Australian public will be able to approach the respective department that will handle this program and submit a business plan. This plan doesn't have to be well presented, and can be written on the back of a napkin if the applicant doesn't have enough money to present it any other way. The applicant will have to prove that they are acting in the interest of all Australians and not themselves (other that gaining employment for themselves in an industry and prospective company that interests them of course).</p>

<p>The companies will not be Australian owned, but they will not be owned by anyone from overseas either. They will be self-sufficient companies that aren't owned by anyone (non-trading co-operatives). Because their will not be any shareholders to pay dividends to, all the profits will (and must as a criteria) go back into improving the company or supporting charitable causes.</p>

<p>The purpose of this program is not only to stimulate the local economy, but also to reduce the unemployment rate and reduce the margin between rich and poor by gradually weeding out leeching shareholders. Companies of this nature will also enhance the sense of national spirit and pride, and also to promote mateship and friendship towards fellow Australians. It will also promote the idea of working for a living.</p>

<p>Not every submitted proposal will be receive support, or the initial proposal may be improved during consultation between the administration and the applicant, and the level of support will be varied according to how promising the idea is and the amount of thinking and work that the applicant has put in. It will also depend on the history of the applicant, and also their nature and personality. Applicants may receive tuition or mentoring from the administration if they show promise and will to learn and succeed.</p>

<p>Applicants can either receive money to establish the company and then after a good level of income is reached, the company will begin paying the original loan amount back, or the applicant can receive money to establish the company, but the administration becomes the sole shareholder and will receive a negotiated percentage of profits. The advantages of the second option include advertising and periodic upgrades. The company will be subject to requirements negotiated with the administration.
