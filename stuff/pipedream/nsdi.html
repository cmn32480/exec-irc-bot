<p>One of the reasons for the recent resentment of the United States by many developed nations of the world is that the United States is becoming a highly militarised nation, and the US Defence Department needs to be able to justify to not only the US Government, but also the US people the importance of having such a large military at its disposal. War is the only justification for the existence of a war machine, so by having a large military with a clear advantage over the rest of the world due to a high level of technology incorporated into its defensive and offensive hardware, it is indirectly informing the world of its intentions through a new "pre-emptive" attack strategy, which the events of September 11, 2001 served to justify.</p>

<p>Australia would be far better off by not focusing so much on development of its large mobile offensive hardware, but more on hardware intended mainly for the defence of Australian territory that might possibly include anti-missile and anti-aircraft missile batteries, countermeasures, unmanned combat vehicles, and early-warning systems. Dealing with threats offensively should occur through development of hardware for intelligence gathering and support for more small elite operations units like the SAS, as well as improving tactics and strategy. This would not only help to maintain good relations between Australia and other nations, but would also be perceived as more of a threat to terrorists and other hostiles. Reducing the cost of materials purchased for hardware is an important factor, as large mobile offensive hardware like ships, tanks and aircraft cost millions of dollars to construct, and losses of these in conflict can significantly affect a nation's budget.</p>

<p>The advantages to be had are in development of tactics and strategy, and associated hardware, to deal with threats before they have a chance to have any significant impact. The associated hardware for this currently consists mainly of satellites and UAVs for tracking and intelligence gathering. These don't place any members of military services at risk, and as UAVs are smaller and cheaper to build than fighter and bomber aircraft, their loss has less economic impact. Satellites have the advantage of being in a position where they are difficult to reach by anything but large Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and specialised anti-satellite missiles, which are contained in the arsenals of only the most powerful nations of the world.</p>

<p>If less emphasis was placed on developing large mobile offensive hardware, and more emphasis was placed on territorial defence and smaller scale offensive technologies, it would also have a positive impact of the Australian public. There were large peace protests when the Federal Government sent troops overseas to Iraq, which led to a divided nation and a small level of political instability. However, this political instability could have become significant if the result of the war in Iraq was such that all of the 2000 lives that were sent became severely compromised due to defeat of the coalition by the Iraqi military and its allies.</p>

<p>It is becoming increasingly difficult for the United Nations to undergo peace-keeping efforts around the world as a result of the changing face of terrorism, which has lead to an increased threat to the populations of the nations involved in any military action. This uncertainty of the results of taking military action against a foe where its allies could be within the borders of any nation in the world has led to widespread divisions in both the political powers concerned with taking military action, such as those of the UN, and the general populations of those nations. It is therefore clear that a different approach to combating terrorist threats needs to be developed and established, other than direct large-scale military action.</p>

<p>This military action, which has usually been directed at the governing regimes of entire nations, impacts significantly on the populations of the nations that the regimes have control over. Usually, much of the infrastructure of the country, including power and drinking water services, is destroyed, and more now by the regime of that country rather than invading forces. Any new approach should reduce the adverse affects on the innocent populations under any targeted regimes.</p>

<p>It is difficult to develop countermeasures to combat chemical and biological threats, and even if they are developed, it is unlikely that a solution can apply to an entire affected population.</p>
<p>The only feasible strategy for combating chemical and biological threats is to prevent the use of such weapons in the first place. This can only be achieved with superior intelligence gathering capabilities and efficient covert operations.</p>
<p>If weapons are discovered, they can be neutralised efficiently by covert tactical units with minimal risk of collateral damage. These units can be trained to operate independently such that they can't be linked to any particular nation and thus eliminates the possibility of diplomatic repercussions. The employment of smaller, more highly trained forces will result in a number of benefits for both the government and the Australian people, including:</p>
<p>1. Requirement of either less funding to operate and maintain the ADF, or increased capabilities through acquisition of more sophisticated equipment and an increase in research and development.</p>
<p>2. Increased contentment of the Australian public. During military operations, the likelihood of protests will reduce due to the decrease in the number of personnel involved in military action. This will eliminate the possibility of public backlash as a result of military action by the government, and also reduce the capacity of the government to initiate hostilities.</p>
<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF INTELLIGENCE</p>
<p>The defence strategy of most nations currently involves the development of large mobile offensive hardware like aircraft, shipping, and ground vehicles such as tanks. In today's social environment however, there are increased political risks from engaging in direct large scale military action. The public of not only the nations directly involved in military action during the recent war in Iraq, but of many other nations whose governments were either neutral or opposed to military action were deeply divided, and there were world-wide peace rallies organised which were drew support from large numbers of people. This has also occurred during other conflicts in the past, such as operations in Vietnam and Korea.</p>
<p>The threat to national security is also changing. Mostly prior to the end of World War II, the threat lay in occupation by hostile foreign nations such as Germany and Japan, whereas now the threat is more from organised multinational terrorism. These cells are very difficult to break down, and it has been shown that only after significant acts of terror, such as those on the World Trade Center in New York City, and in Bali, is substantial progress usually made.</p>
<p>Traditional military threats, such as the threat of occupation by a hostile nation, should be dealt with in the future through multilateral diplomatic pressure. Should diplomacy fail, small covert units can be deployed to achieve tactical objectives.</p>
<p>Nuclear threats from hostile nations can only be dealt with through research into new missile countermeasure technologies such as high energy laser batteries. Anti-missile missiles can never be made to hit their target with a sufficiently high reliability due to their physical limitations such as acceleration and speed. Improved early-warning systems should also be developed to reduce the nuclear threat.</p>
<p>Australia's offensive solution should consist of a number of small covert tactical units, and the development of small unmanned mobile offensive hardware including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Satellites owned by the Australian Defence Force are essential for intelligence gathering to coordinate both defensive and offensive activities.</p>
<p>To combat the threat of terrorism, the use of satellites for intelligence gathering becomes very important through the ability to obtain high resolution images of suspected areas of terrorist activity. This allows intelligence gathering without intervention, and is fast and easy. Then using small highly trained specialised combat teams similar to those of the SAS, terrorist threats could be neutralised efficiently and by surprise, and with reduced collateral damage.</p>
<p>Australia is currently fairly highly regarded for its intelligence gathering capabilities. However, foreign owned or operated satellites are relied on at great expense to the tax payer. Using Australian owned and operated satellites for intelligence gathering and relying less on foreign sources will reduce the risk of intelligence gathering capabilities becoming compromised for any reason, and will also lead to the perception that Australia's military capabilities have increased without increasing the perception of Australia as a military threat.</p>
<p>In the past, the remoteness of Australia relative to the majority of populated continents of the world meant that it was inherently more secure. Due to both the advances in military technology, and the changing face of threat to peace, Australians can no longer be complacent about security. While the risk of occupation by hostile nationalities has decreased since World War II, a new threat has risen to become the top priority in defence strategies around the world, particularly for developed nations, this threat being that of terrorism. This isn't the sort of traditional military threat that can be clearly identified like tanks and aircraft or even individual soldiers. It takes the innocent form of airliners with potentially hundreds of passengers on board, or individual people in crowded shopping plazas. These seemingly innocent parts of everyday life have been used to topple two of the largest skyscrapers in the world, and have killed hundreds of innocent civilians doing their shopping. These threats can't be combated with tanks or aircraft.</p>
<p>The only way terrorism can be dealt with is by intelligence tracking it down and preventing it before it even becomes a threat. While Australia's intelligence gathering can be compared with the best in the world, we rely heavily on other nations for information particularly from satellites. Satellite technology is becoming the new weapon of war in gathering intelligence both for armed military conflict such as in the recent overthrow of the Taliban and Bath Party regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq respectively. Without superior intelligence, these conflicts would have involved much higher numbers of fatalities of both civilians and military personnel alike, due to the changes in the way war is conducted as a result of improved intelligence.</p>
<p>Coalitions are conducting wars through the use of precision guided weapons and elite special operations to target specific military threats rather than using large munitions to devastate entire areas where a threat is perceived to be. This sort of precision targeting is only possible with satellite and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imaging.</p>
<p>Australia's status as an intelligence gathering nation would increase the perception of Australia as a threat to other hostile nations or terrorist organisations without the perception that we are a hostile nation ourselves, as well as putting Australia in a better position to help coalitions such as the United Nations deal with terrorism on the global scale.</p>
<p>While the United States is clearly the leader in the "War Against Terror", through its highly militarised efforts to combat terrorism it is damaging its relations with other peaceful nations, as well as dividing its own people.</p>

<p><b>Defence</b></p>
<p>Having a defence force consisting of large and costly offensive hardware only leads to a desire to use it to justify the expense.</p>
<p>Companies and organisations that specialise purely in offensive military hardware should be discouraged or banned altogether.</p>
<p>Australia needs a 'defence' force, not an 'offence' force. We need to carefully analyse any threats and treat them appropriately.</p>
<p>Having the biggest tanks and the fastest planes does not necessarily aid the defence of a nation, particularly in relation to terrorism.</p>
<p>A highly visible enemy can be prepared for, but one that is hidden and informed is more challenging. Defending Australia covertly will not only be seen by
possible enemy forces as more of a threat, but it will help to maintain positive relations with neighbouring nations due to a
reduction in war machinery and thus less desire to use such machinery without just cause.</p>

<p>When the terrorist attacks occurred in the US on September 11, 2001, the US government
opted for a pre-emptive warfare solution to counterterrorism. Thus
far this strategy has had some effect, but has cost billions of
dollars world-wide and a great many lives both military and civilian.
The problem with the strategy used was that everyone knew basically
what to expect, including terrorists. The highly publicised response
of the intentions of the US government and military resulted in time
for terrorists to prepare for those intentions to be acted on.</p>

<p>While the days of
foreign invasion aren't necessarily over, the possibility of a
country invading another without multilateral backlash has reduced
since World War II. Internal and border disputes between neighbouring
countries do occur, including a dispute between East Timor and
Australia over oil. These problems should be solved by negotiation
between the countries involved. If this fails, multilateral action by
the UN may be required. Waging of war between the involved parties is
not civilised and a declaration of war under such circumstances is an
admission of political and diplomatic incompetence, and immaturity.</p>

<p>To defend our homeland
against the new threat of international terrorism, two elements are
required to work together. Intelligence is required to know as much
about the enemy as possible and where they will strike, and small
elite covert operations task forces (such as the current SAS) are
required to deal with threats with minimal collateral damage.</p>

<p>For Australia to be a
threat to terrorism, we must be smart and know our enemy such that we
can do everything within our means to prevent acts of terrorism
before they occur. Invading another nation after a terrorist attack
with guns blazing and blowing up everything except the intended
target will only result in resentment of the government by the
Australian public and much of the rest of the world. Million dollar
cruise missiles are capable of hitting a specified window on a
specific building from miles away, but the technology of the enemy
can never be underestimated. To highlight this, an F-117 Nighthawk
stealth bomber was apparently brought down using a derivative of
mobile phone technology. Remember that technology is powerful, but
through history strategy has shown to be the most potent weapon. Sun
Tzu's &quot;The Art of War&quot; is an acclaimed strategic
masterpiece.</p>

<p><i>"The skilful leader
subdues the enemy's troops without any fighting. He captures their
cities without laying siege to them. He overthrows their kingdom's
government without lengthy operations in the field."</i> - Sun Tzu</p>

<p>The political response
to threats of terrorism should not involve a hard stand, but under
certain circumstances should be to give into demands of would be
terrorists. The interaction between the government and the terrorists
will yield valuable intelligence. When the terrorists &quot;walk
away&quot; with their win, they may start to wonder why key figures
of their organisation start turning up dead or disappearing
altogether. Intelligence, espionage and deception are the most
important and useful tools in combating terrorism, specifically
targeting the highest ranks of terrorist organisations and striking
fear into all those supporting them. United Nations policy regarding
terrorist threats should be to firstly authorise capture of the
terrorist leaders responsible. Assassinations may be authorised in
certain situations. If Australia were the target, the defence
intelligence organisation would immediately start to isolate the
location of the terrorist leaders and plan a tactical operation to
capture or assassinate them. This action would not require further
authorisation from the Australian government, which may be in a
situation where it is incapable of giving such authorisation
directly, or the operation's secrecy may be at risk due to the
possibility of intelligence leaks.</p>

<p>If Australia is
threatened by another nation, key facilities within the opposing
nation should be compromised with little warning to that nation, and
with minimal casualties to their civilian population (minimal
collateral damage). The leadership of that nation should also be
targeted by both Australian tactical operations and United Nations
multilateral policy. In circumstances such as a dictatorial leader of
a nation responsible for crimes against humanity or other breaches of
the Geneva Convention, the United Nations should authorise the arrest
of that leader. If the leader in question resists, the UN should then
consider authorising the capture or assassination of that leader.</p>

<p>Satellites and mobile
reconnaissance vehicles are the key to intelligence gathering, as
well as over the horizon radar and superior decryption technology for
intelligence interception.</p>

<p>The Australian public
doesn't need the burden of having to sustain large military hardware
such as ships, planes and tanks. Small armoured personnel carriers
and transport vehicles, as well as small, fast, highly manoeuvrable
helicopters for deploying and recovering covert operation forces in
the field are the only major hardware requirements. Small, expendable
intelligence gathering drones developed locally should be employed.</p>

<p>Satellites are
extremely expensive with current launch technology. That is why it is
important to solve the problem of cheap access to space as soon as
possible to take advantage of the new strategic &quot;high ground&quot;.</p>

<p>The money saved by scaling down and refining the capabilities of the defence force could be significant and may go towards reducing the national debt.</p>

<p><b>Science</b></p>

<p>For Australia to become
and maintain a strong global economic position, we must be smart. The
top priority should be to eliminate the &quot;brain drain&quot;. This
can only be achieved by creating opportunities for graduates here in
Australia. This means starting up technology companies and
organisations. Technology companies must work together rather than
compete with one another. This will increase funding pools and
increase the scale of projects that can be conducted, and increase
the benefits that spin off from them. Government grants should be
provided to large cooperatives interested in pursuing new and
existing fields of science and technology, similar to (but more
flexible) than the current Cooperative Research Centres. CRCs are
restrictive because the time limit imposed on their budget is in some
cases is not long enough to achieve any useful outcome. An example of
where this occurs is in the aerospace industry, where projects can
take years just to get off the ground (literally) let alone get
useful data or technological spin offs. Budgets need to be
restricted, but timelines need to be realistic to meet the aim of the
project being proposed.</p>

<p><i>"Earth is the cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever."</i> - Konstantin Tsiolkovsky</p>
<p>Establishment of a national aerospace administration will enable channelling of funds and industry cooperation to begin developing cost efficient aerospace projects and programs.</p>
<p>Such programs will initially include the investigation into and development of an economically feasible fully reusable single stage to Earth orbit shuttle.</p>
<p>All projects relating to anything further than Earth orbit should be scaled back until the vital step of cheap, regular and reliable access to Earth orbit is achieved.</p>
<p>After cheap access to orbit is achieved, a large scale geostationary orbital platform should be developed by the Australian Aerospace Administration to establish permanent telecommunication, defence, scientific, remote sensing, meteorological and astronomical assets.</p>
