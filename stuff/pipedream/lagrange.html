<p><b>What is a Lagrange point?</b></p>

<p>A Lagrange point is a point in space where the gravity of a body and a satellite of that body reach equilibrium. Examples of such bodies and their satellites include the Earth and the Moon, and the Sun and the Earth. This doesn't mean that there is no gravity at Lagrange points, as points between the Earth and the Moon are still affected by the Sun's gravity.</p>

<p>If a space station is built at one of these points, little effort would be required to keep it in a stationary orbit. This is important because everywhere else, periodic course adjustments would be required to prevent gradual orbital decay.</p>

<p><b>Modularised Space Wheel</b></p>

<p>Mass produced vessels could be strung together to form a large-scale space wheel at one of the Lagrange points between the Earth and Moon, with cables used to connect modules at certain intervals to a central hub. A circular shape could be maintained using artificial gravity generated by rotation of the wheel.</p>

<p>Lifting of these modules into space will only become viable when a fully reusable single stage to orbit (SSTO) space shuttle is developed. Specially designed space transport vehicles will make transport of the vessels from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to a Lagrange point more efficient.</p>

<p><b>Why would anyone want to live in a space wheel?</b></p>

<p>The construction of a large-scale space wheel after development of fully reusable SSTO space shuttles will end the era of the "astronaut" and pave the way for anyone to be able to live and work in space. The reason for people wanting to live in a space wheel is simply that a space wheel offers a different way of life. The difference between one "g" (Earth gravity) and microgravity would be just a short trip in a transport car away, and instead of endless ground and sky you would be suspended in space, with views unobstructed by clouds or pollution. There would also be no such thing as bad weather like rain or searing heat, as the entire station would be environmentally controlled.</p>

<p>Some of the jobs that would eventually be available on such a station would be remarkably different to those on Earth, such as space station construction, space vehicle piloting, and maintenance in strange environmental conditions. An example of such condition would be when working in Earth equivalent gravity on the outer edge of the space wheel and hanging in space. There would be many conventional jobs, like those in engineering, science, medicine, as well as labour, human services such as selling products and providing services, construction within the wheel, equipment operation, and trades. There would also be opportunities for further space exploration, such as missions to Mars, which would become much more feasible if constructed and launched from the space wheel. Deep space missions would become more realistic after further research and development both on Earth and on the space wheel.</p>

<p><b>Post-Wheel Development</b></p>

<p>Further into the future, manufacturing and mineral processing facilities will be a high priority to ensure the economic and physical feasibility of long-term space habitation. Ore from the Moon could be mined and transported to the station, where steel, glass and other materials could be produced to build spacecraft structures. Steel could be used as a structural material because spacecraft built in space don't need to be launched to escape Earth's gravity. Construction of a new habitation wheel further out from the existing modularised wheel will eventually take place. As this new wheel could be made from steel, it would be much stronger and could be made much larger. Construction will commence on opposite sides of the existing wheel to balance out the offset in the centre of gravity that the new wheel would be gradually adding to otherwise. This new wheel could be the fulfilment of the dreams of many, with room for individual dwellings and vegetation converting carbon dioxide and water into much needed oxygen. The diameter of this new wheel would be approximately 1km.</p>

<p><b>Lagrange Space Tube</b></p>

<p>Further into the future, the space wheel could be turned from a wheel into a solid disc, and eventually discs could be added along the axis running through the centre of the station, using existing discs for structural support to assist in construction. The station would eventually form a sort of rotating tube, the wheel being added to such that there would be no gaps and the whole structure could be pressurised. The final tube would be a single cavernous world in space, forming a lagrange space tube.</p>
