<p>Welcome to a website dedicated to the topic of Australia's future in space.</p>

<p>It has been established and will remain operated voluntarily by an Australian space enthusiast for fellow enthusiasts to discuss ideas. Article content is subjective and intended to stimulate discussion, but the hope is that someday the website may come to represent a wider cross-section of opinions through submission of comments and articles, and that online interaction may eventually lead to collaboration.</p>

<p>Ideas can come from anywhere. Credentials aren't required to make a valuable contribution to discussion on this website. Ideas can be conservative or eccentric, but there is no such thing as a bad idea. This website is all about what could be, not what is, and almost anything is possible so reality checks aren't necessary.</p>

<p>Space should be used for exploration, adventure, discovery and inspiration, and should not be the domain of profit or war. The business ethics that we pass on to our children, who will be the spacefarers of the future, should be those of co-operation, not competition.</p>

<p><b>The issue of a national space agency and single point of contact...</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt"><i>Author: Jared Crutchfield<br>Modified: 5 December 2011</i></span></p>

<p>This is the most significant and immediate obstacle for anyone interested in space or working for space-related organisations and companies in Australia. Without it, scientific and engineering objectives are just pie in the sky dreams and organisations will always be in competition for measly insufficient government grants rather than cooperating with each other, and due to the huge financial resources required to get into space, no significant progress can ever be made. Even the remarkable progress made in development of the scramjet project will eventually wind up offshore long before it becomes a marketable service required for self-sustainment, unless a more collaborative industry can be formed.</p>

<p>How can a sustainable, recognised and successful single point of contact for aerospace projects in Australia be established?</p>

<p>The following questions are also some that must be answered:</p>

<p>1. What form should a single point of contact take (private organisation, government department)?<br>
2. How could a point of contact solve the problems facing industry, such as "confusion as to who does what" and "who is able to fund what" [Page 22, <?php InternalHyperlink("?page=links#ref09","Ref. 9"); ?>]?<br>
3. What opportunities could be taken advantage of after the establishment of a point of contact?<br>
4. What factors may threaten the establishment and operation of a point of contact?<br>
5. What roles/functions could a point of contact perform?<br>
6. Where could funding originate from (or how could it be generated)?<br>
7. What steps would be necessary for the establishment of a point of contact?<br>
8. How could this contact gain local and international recognition?</p>

<p>While many space enthusiasts aren't businesspeople or champions of a cause, most would possibly be willing to risk time, effort and perhaps some minor expenses for a private non-profit co-operative aerospace administration. There would be plenty who could offer technical and administrative skills, but there may also be some managerial, marketing and accounting types who are interested in space that might like to be involved. In exchange for their efforts, senior positions may be offered to suitable contributors as the organistion begins the formal recruitment process. The key (as for any new business) is always reducing risk and building a solid business case.</p>

<p>Few would be willing to be as charitable for a government agency. The government's current attitude towards space (as a user rather than a provider of services) demonstrates a lack of capacity to offer much toward this nation's space future. Fortunately, this is financially responsible, and it reduces the likelihood of Australia falling into the trap of establishing a NASA-like bureaucracy and ruining the prospect of success of a private non-profit administration. Maintaining a government space agency that does anything more than shuffle paper is a <i>very</i> expensive burden for taxpayers. Our hard-earned taxes should always go toward more essential services like health and education. There are aspects of these that are provided by space technology (communication satellites for example), but it is doubtful that a government agency could deliver any savings for taxpayers in these areas.</p>

<p><i>Apart from funding through grants or loans, enforcement and regulation of safety of space activities is at most the only space related function that the government need be involved in.</i></p>

<p>A national space agency shouldn't be controlled by government, as elections are too frequent to allow for achievement of major long term goals, and capitalist enterprise simply doesn't have enough money. If the largest aerospace corporations like Boeing and Lockheed Martin can't succeed in developing space technologies without federal government assistance, and projects like the Lockheed Martin X-33/VentureStar have failed, what hope of success is there for any other company in getting the significant long term investment required? Long term research and development goals can have adverse effects on short term shareholder satisfaction, which is risky in a volatile sharemarket, and there are plenty of big players out there ready to take advantage of any new market opportunity where someone else has already put in the hard yards. A non-profit cooperative enterprise would have the best chance of achieving success due to a significant potential for consumer sentiment resulting from mass marketing and a policy of rapid and large scale business expansion.</p>

<p>Generation and channelling of funding is the big issue for space research and development projects. A non-profit parent organisation would eventually own and be financially supported by a multitude of "profitable" subsidiaries in various industries (not just aerospace). All income not used for subsidiary business development and operating expenses would go into the research and development activities of the parent. Mass marketing would be used to drive consumer sentiment. The intention would be to build up a co-operative empire to support research and development, and spinoffs would be profited from to establish more subsidiaries and fund more research and development.</p>

<p>To prevent the organisation from becoming another NASA-like bureaucracy, each research and development project would be established as a subsidiary business. Each subsidiary would be established based on a business plan, allocated capital from the parent organisation, and a marketable product or service developed which would then be mass marketed using the parent organisation's media machine. Everything would be operated on a budget, and a profit to the parent organisation would be expected in the planned timeframe. The only exception to this rule would be X-projects, which would be run by the parent organisation directly and would not be expected to make a profit. However, any profitable spinoffs from an X-project would form the basis of further subsidiary startups. Any projects and businesses that are no longer viable in the long term or that become insolvent shall be investigated by the organisation and assessed for liquidation. The loss of jobs from liquidation may be offset by the establishment or expansion of other viable subsidiaries, but the organisation cannot afford to engage in sustaining an unprofitable workforce.</p>

<p>This venture would start up as a not for profit organisation (NPO) with a couple of subsidiary startups funded by government grants/assistance, business loans etc. It must be based on a solid business plan. Short-term venture capital may be a possibility, but would preferably be based on a fixed agreed return so that the organisation is able to buy back shares at a reasonable price. Non-profit tax status is beneficial but not critical. If the organisation must pay unrelated business income tax, then so be it. Paying tax doesn't make the organisation worse off than any profitable corporation. However, the organisation will retain the advantage over corporations by not having shareholders demanding dividends. The organisation should expand as much as possible into both related and unrelated industries to generate revenue. Any possible tax concessions can be sorted out with the ATO as new revenue sources are established. Loans would ideally be from government to ensure interest repayments went into the public pockets, but loans could also be from banks.</p>

<p>Joe Public should be able to go to his local bank, which happens to be a subsidiary of a non-profit aerospace administration, knowing from a barrage of television advertising that the fees are comparable with the NAB or CBA across the street. Not everyone is a space enthusiast, and he doesn't need to care about space, but he must have drummed into his head that his money is better spent giving his kids a future and improving his quality of life than padding the pockets of greedy shareholders.</p>

<p><b>The issue of cheap, reliable and safe access to low earth orbit...</b></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 8pt"><i>Author: Jared Crutchfield<br>Modified: 10 December 2011</i></span></p>

<p>The first and foremost research and development objective for a national space organisation must be the provision of cheap reliable access to low earth orbit. Not only would this enable dreams to become reality, but it would open up huge market potential to fund further research and development activities by such an organisation. Using the X-program approach, this goal could be achieved with minimal fuss and expense compared to traditional space programs (<a href="http://www.jerrypournelle.com/reports/jerryp/gettospace.html" target="_blank">this page</a> justifies).</p>

<p>A small transport shuttle with perhaps two jet engines and rockets around the jet exhausts may be a possible solution. Jet engine intakes could be retractable into the belly to protect the engines during re-entry. Technologies including aerospikes (possibly using the jet exhaust nozzles as part of the aerospikes) carbon aerogels and perhaps the feathering effect employed by SpaceShipOne may also contribute to the success of such a craft, but there should be a focus on getting the most out of existing technology. Time and money researching new technologies shouldn't be spent unless absolutely necessary, and only after the limits of current technology have been proven.</p>

<p>It's interesting that even Lockheed Martin has conceded that "[investors] will finance space systems built with existing technology, but [they] will not finance systems built with promising revolutionary technologies - not at any price" [<?php InternalHyperlink("?page=links#ref08","Ref. 8"); ?>].</p>

<p>The Cold War is over so beating the Russians won't justify spending huge sums of taxpayer money to get to the Moon. Not only is everyone employed by a large government bureaucracy as NASA trying to justify their own salary, but the International Space Station, now defunct Space Transportation System (shuttle), and missions to Mars don't tangibly benefit the common voter. Australia must learn from the mistakes of other nations and not repeat them. Only when access to low earth orbit is cheap, reliable and safe will space stations, missions to the Moon and Mars etc become economically viable.</p>

<p>Burt Rutan's achievement with SpaceShipOne should have rung alarm bells througout the space industries of the world, because while SpaceShipOne didn't enter low earth orbit, it proved in principle that space can be accessed on a relatively low budget.</p>

<p>A small horizontal takeoff and landing fully reusable single stage to low earth orbit transport (for maybe three crew and 1000 kg of payload) is a realistic goal, and a fleet of these would enable transport of huge payloads into orbit for a fraction of the cost of using conventional launch systems. The US STS (Shuttle) should not be used as inspiration (it has possibly done more harm than good for the US space program). The means to achieving this objective involves a program similar to that of the X projects (X-1, X-15 etc) conducted by USAF/NASA in the middle of last century which produced the craft that many aerospace enthusiasts envy, and in some cases have not been outperformed even today by comparative vehicles. These projects were short, relatively low cost, with limited goals (not payload oriented), conducted in unpleasant places, and did not result in the problems facing current agencies, such as career building, budget blowouts, program commitments and huge staff numbers [<?php InternalHyperlink("?page=links#ref06","Ref. 6"); ?>]. X projects were conducted to establish the limits of existing technology and were conducted in remote and unpleasant places so that those involved had motivation to complete the project as quickly as practically possible on the given budget [<?php InternalHyperlink("?page=links#ref06","Ref. 6"); ?>]. These programs were very successful and paved the way for current space programs. It's important to distinguish later programs like the X-33 from the original X projects, because the X-33 did not share these vital characteristics, which ultimately lead to its failure.</p>

<p>Doubters aren't doers. If we ever really want to get to the stars, we must reach for the stars, and the ideas that
will make this possible won't come from government departments or corporate boardrooms. If we have learned anything from past space exploration forays it is that throwing enough money at a
problem like this will not solve it. Engineers and scientists <i>must</i> be in the driver's seat of this project, which is why conducting it out in the middle of some remote inhospitable
desert is needed to discourage the bureaucrats, lawyers, beancounters and ladder-climbers from getting in the way of real progress. Technical people can create the seemingly impossible on
a shoestring budget if they are passionate about the goal and given the opportunity to work together, and that's the sort of people we need.</p>
