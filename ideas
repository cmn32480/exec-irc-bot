EXEC IDEAS
==========


~karma on|off (works like ~sed)

github repository change monitoring (kinda like feeds)


github/slashcode issue submission/listing


SN crawler/mapper

~proc count|list|kill|etc (inside bot)


~remind
set bucket with start time
if exec restarts, check all remind buckets to see if any haven't expired yet
and reset them with new sleep time to trigger at correct intended time

~define -f term
uses cprivmsg to output more (avoids flood control if exec is channel operator)
or something like !more to output some more content


SoylentNews comment feed
- similar to bender but outputs comment summaries
- nicks can use ~mod to moderate last comment
(if a trial run is positive, maybe ask staff for moderation priveliges for the exec user)
- poll to see if exec has mod points before output feed



EXEC MODULARISATION:
- bot.php
  executes irc.php in separate process
  executes bucket_manager.php in separate process
  passes data between processes
- bot_lib.php
  contains common bot functions and constant declarations
- irc.php
  contains irc program loop. passes all unprocessed data string to line.php as separate process
- line.php
  takes raw irc line, parses it, and executes aliases as required (uses same process management functions as irc.php)
- bucket_manager.php
  stores bucket data in process memory. handles bucket requests

watchdog process - prospectacle

FEATURE REQUESTS:

<stderr> Feature request for exec: Convert "0.7 hrs" to minutes


<bytram> re weather crutchy: maybe, instead, try it with the given case, and if it comes back with nothing, then (and only then) try it case insensitive?
