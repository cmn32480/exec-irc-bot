EXEC IDEAS
==========


~karma on|off (works like ~sed)

github repository change monitoring (kinda like feeds)


~remind
set bucket with start time
if exec restarts, check all remind buckets to see if any haven't expired yet
and reset them with new sleep time to trigger at correct intended time


FEATURE REQUESTS:

<stderr> Feature request for exec: Convert "0.7 hrs" to minutes
