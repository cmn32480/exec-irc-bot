<crutchy> i've rolled my own little website that had articles and ability to comment on them, but it was way off being ready for public use
<crutchy> still got the source code floating around somewhere
<crutchy> didn't have the ability to submit articles though
* crutchy wonders if it might be worth having another go. making it similar to slash/pipedot but without some of the cruft
<crutchy> maybe a bit of irc integration too :p
<crutchy> wtf. just got * Disconnected (Invalid argument). on freenode
<chromas> weird
<crutchy> server must've farted
<crutchy> back on now
<chromas> server_farts--
<Bender> karma - server_farts: -1
<chromas> I did a thing in php once, it was more of a generic website thinger and you could wikilink between pages. Didn't get around to comments though
* crutchy is setting up news.my.to
<chromas> Did you find the code?
* crutchy is such a cheapskate :p
<chromas> crutchdot
<crutchy> yeah. prolly won't use it though
<crutchy> i've learned a shitload since then
<crutchy> it was also pre-pdo
<chromas> Yeah, now we can make a p2p comments thing in delphi
<crutchy> i dunno what the best way to authenticate is
<crutchy> i don't wanna store passwords
<crutchy> in any form
<chromas> for your php one?
<crutchy> yeah
<chromas> Set a cookie
<chromas> The user can delete it anytime they want
<crutchy> yeah that might be easiest
<crutchy> if they delete the cookie and someone steals their nick, tough shit
<chromas> instead of usernames, each person gets a randomized token, which they can change any time they want
<chromas> l3r01g3dr says: "ef here, nigger nigger nigger! I'm out, bitches"
<crutchy> lol
<crutchy> could always have ability to load cookie from a file
<crutchy> as a backup
<chromas> yeah
<chromas> 4chan has some sort of authentication thing that most people don't use
<crutchy> and if i hash the nick would be harder to forge
<crutchy> i rarely post comments as myself even on SN
<crutchy> that's pretty much the whole user management system worked out then... a cookie with a nick hash :p
<chromas> nice
<crutchy> (and a cookie uploader and hidden post fields for those that don't like cookies)
<chromas> cookies wouldn't be so bad if every website didn't store fifty thousand
<crutchy> i surf with cookies disabled
<chromas> makes it work to manage
<crutchy> the old cms i made allowed either hidden post fields or cookies
<crutchy> spent a lot of time on security, but that was cos it stored passwords
<crutchy> in the end i got so paranoid about storing passwords that i just gave up on it
<chromas> passwords are okay, just salt each one with a different porn video then sha1 it fifty million times
<crutchy> (mainly cos people use the same password for everything even though they shouldn't, so if my site is hacked its worse)
<chromas> that's where salting comes in handy
<crutchy> i like the idea of a hashed nick though, cos people never gunna use a password for a nick :p
<chromas> they could be generated like url shorteners :D
<crutchy> hmm. actually hashing wouldn't really be useful maybe
<crutchy> cos the unhashed nick is public :/
<crutchy> so if someone wanna forge, they just hash it theirself
<chromas> You could make the nick itself a hash
<crutchy> hmm. actually i could make it a hash of ip and nick
<chromas> Then it's more 'anonymous' but you can have an identity throughout a thread (until you don't want it anymore and press regen or check anon)
<crutchy> makes it so people can't reuse nick on different ip's but meh. they can do similar to irc; crutchy_mobile or summin
<crutchy> yeah i think anon will be default and most likely to be used
<crutchy> although if i don't implement a karma system then people won't be afraid to post as themselves
<crutchy> then i open the door to spam, but with a mod system that might be less of a problem
<chromas> You could pass comments through spamassassin or something
<chromas> A few mods can train it by manually marking spam/not spam, then adjust it when it's wrong
<crutchy> yeah. or roll a simple checker; no identical comments in same thread, no identical comments by same ip on same day, etc
<chromas> I wonder how that would work out if there was a separate dataset for that for each of the different mod types, so it could learn to mark things as "insightful"
<crutchy> or if ip has been modded down too many times maybe set a cool off period
<chromas> slash used to have duplicate comment checking
<chromas> and yeah, more than three or four links or more than one instance of the same link
<chromas> You linked to "MyCleanPC too many times. Feck off"
<crutchy> nod. i would prolly not allow hyperlinking initially
<crutchy> lol
<crutchy> hyperlinking reminds me too much of reddit :p
<chromas> it'd be nifty to have it insert page titles into the link title, but of course, that opens up some bad possibilities
